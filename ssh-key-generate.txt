Create an SSH key on your computer and upload the public key to GitHub

1. Check if you already have an SSH key
Open your terminal and run:

ls -al ~/.ssh


If you see files like id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, you already have a key.

2. Create a new SSH key
Run this command:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


-t rsa → type of key (RSA)

-b 4096 → key size (4096 bits)

-C "your_email@example.com" → adds a label (usually your email)

Press Enter to save it in the default location.
You’ll also be asked if you want a password (passphrase).

Enter a password for more security (recommended).

Or just press Enter to skip.

3. Add the key to the SSH agent
This makes sure you don’t need to type the password every time.

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


4. Copy the public key
Run:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


Copy the result and paste it into GitHub → Settings > SSH and GPG keys.

On macOS, you can copy directly to clipboard:

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


5. Test the connection
Run:

ssh -T git@github.com


If it works, GitHub will greet you with your username.

⚠️ Important:

Never share your private key (id_rsa).

Only share the public key (id_rsa.pub).
